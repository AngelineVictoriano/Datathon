## HexData Datathon

Welcome to our share file repository for upcoming Datathon presentation. This group project is part of our "Introduction to data science in healthcare" module

The files are organized into folder named as raw data, processed data, plots, output and other files. The code are contained in either R script or R markdown files depending on the team contributor.

The visualisation generated are to be used in the final presentation and the personal reports.
